RootSpy uses an scons-based build system. 

To configure the build system, please add $ROOTSPY/build
to your PYTHONPATH and PERL5LIB environment variables

To build both the client library and the RootSpy GUI program, 
just do the following:

  scons install


RootSpy requires cMsg3.0 or greater and ROOT 5.18.00 or greater.
The CMSROOT and ROOTSYS environment variables must be set correctly.

We also allow for installing in other directories somehow.
